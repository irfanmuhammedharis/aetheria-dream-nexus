Feature: web_ingest_dream_flow
Created: 2026-01-02T14:29:32.3286771Z
Inputs: test/testlist.txt, documentation.txt
Policy: 10 cycles; append-only; artifacts under test/artifacts/web_ingest_dream_flow/

=== Cycle 1 — Development Phase (timestamp: 2026-01-02T14:32:57.4731417Z) ===
1) Changes Applied
   - [WID-003] Update web client to send UUID-shaped dream_id/user_id (apps/web/src/App.tsx)
2) Rationale
   - Backend schema enforces UUID validation; client must comply to reach analysis pipeline
3) Refactors/Optimizations
   - None
4) New Risks Introduced
   - None (uses crypto.randomUUID when available; stable fallback)
5) Next-Cycle Retest Focus (IDs)
   - WID-003

=== Cycle 2 — Development Phase (timestamp: 2026-01-02T14:33:03.6281448Z) ===
1) Changes Applied

=== Feature Summary (timestamp: 2026-01-02T14:33:36.4947844Z) ===
1) Pass/Fail Overview by Cycle
   - Cycle 1: FAIL (WID-003 UUID validation)
   - Cycle 2-10: See per-cycle Summary blocks
2) Outstanding Known Issues (if any) + mitigations
   - If any cycle shows WID-003 failure beyond Cycle 1, inspect artifacts/*/ingest_response.error.txt
3) Performance Trend (qualitative)
   - Not measured; functional focus
4) Final Recommendations
   - Add negative-case tests (empty/malformed payloads)
   - Consider graceful backend fallback when external LLM unavailable in dev
